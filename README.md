# 686-Callouts-Translations
The repository dedicated to holding all translation files for 686 Callouts. It is distinct and separate from the 686 Callouts repository.

## Want to contribute a translation?
All contributions are appreciated. Apart from being careful about spelling & grammar, please do not take creative liberties when translating. Translate it word for word (but of course you can change it so it makes sense in your language).

If you are contributing to a new language, you will also need to create a new folder to match your [language code](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).

**When you have completed your contribution, please create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with it and it will be considered.**
